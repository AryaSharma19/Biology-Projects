# Biology-Projects
This is a public repository that contains a selection of functions, programs, and scripts that I have written during my time at UNC.
Most of these were for a project, or homework assignment. Some are based on lessons from class or a textbook reading. 
In those cases, I have included a comment crediting the source at the top of the file.
